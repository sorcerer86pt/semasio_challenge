Semasio challenge

Given an array of integers, find the maximum product between two numbers from the array, that is a multiple of 3.

The result for the input {6,8,8,7,2,5} should be 48 = 6 x 8. Note that 8 x 8 is the greatest product (64) but 64 isn't divisible by 3.

Given the input {1,9,2,4} the result should be  36 = 9 x 4, and not 81 (9 x 9) since you shouldn't multiply a number by itself.
